This project aims to create a smart chatbot that can understand and sort user questions into three groups: recipes recommendations, exercise recommendation, and help with any problems they may have (Customer support). The system should be response accurately to all users and provide helpful 
answers when users ask questions. 
The solution methodology involves several steps. First, data collection and preprocessing to ensure the datasets quality. The K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN) model is implemented and trained to classify user queries accurately. A pre-trained T5 model is fine-tuned to generate customer support responses. The 
system is integrated into a web platform using React for the front-end, Node.js for the web server, and Flask for handling machine learning model requests
